flot
====

no database (flat) CMS, written in PHP, aiming to be super simple and flexible enough to be used by anybody to make any kind of website.

a totally responsive 'administration' section will allow for website managers to edit the websites from their phone or tablet as well as everyday computer.

with support for themes (but including a few sensible ones to start with) you can make your flot website completely your own.

A plugin architecture will make extending it easy, should you wish to make anything more than a quick simple website.

Optimised for speed to be as fast as possible, letting you focus on just writing great content and not the technology behind it. Your sites pages will be compressed and minified as best as your webserver allows, flot will also understand your server, and give you instructions on what you might change to increase performance (don't worry, this is optional).

Fleixble taxonomies (data types) will make adding webpages that make sense to your website easy, e.g. make a hotel room page, or a product page, or a cake recipe page, etc.

A Hybrid static/dynamic architecture means you get the benegits of a data driven site (being able to login and change the website, without toughing code), but also the benefits of a static site (speed).

Despite storing the content you enter (web page content, images, etc), flot doesn't need a database. This is great. It means one less security risk, one less 'thing' to set up, one less thing to migrate if you move your site, and getting web hosting will be cheaper and easier.

Flot was written in PHP, since it's the most common webserver language, and so getting hosting will be no problem.

Flot is open source, which means totally free.

For now, flot is still being developed, but coming together quickly. Check out the <a href="//flot.io">flot website</a>, or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/flot_io">flot on twitter</a> to stay updated.
